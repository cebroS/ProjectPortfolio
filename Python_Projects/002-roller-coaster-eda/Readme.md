## Objective
- To analyze and establish relationship between features of roller coaster across USA.

## Dataset Summary 
- The provided dataset contains information about ~1200 roller coasters across USA. Information such as height, speed, number of inversions, year of estbalishment,etc was provided.

## Process 
- Exploratory data analysis was performed using Python but plotting charts at multiple cuts. Also correlation between various features was established using correlation heatmap.								
- Process involved the following :
  - Data Understanding
  - Data Cleaning/Preparation
  - Feature Understanding
  - Feature Relationships   

## Insights : 

- Most number of roller coasters were introduced in the year 1999 and 2000.
- In the frequency distribution of speed, its visible that most coasters have speed ranging 40-60mph.
- There's direct correlation between height and speed of the roller coaster. Also lastest coasters were more advanced and have hihger speed than earlier ones.
